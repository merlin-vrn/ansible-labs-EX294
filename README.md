# Labs for Ansible (EX294)

This is my homework / scratchbook things that I did while attending to the Red Hat Ansible Automation course by Sander van Vugt. It contains my solution to all labs suggested by the instructor. The setup doesn't strictly follow the one suggested in the course, I did that to work more comfortably.
